<h1>McDonalds vs. the Burger King Impossible Burger</h1>
<p>We have a problem, last October, Burger King came out with a new product from Burger King - The Impossible Burger. The CEO wants to know how the impossible burger impacts McDonalds' sales. Here are some analysis on the daily and monthly sales, so the CEO can decide what should be done in order to make more $$.</p>
<p>Here are some of the analysis that will be shown: </p>

<h2>Let's start with the monthly sales data. On the Macro scale: </h2>
<p>The line chart below is the total monthly sales over the years of 2016 - 2019. We can see that there is a big drop around the end of 2018, which is when the Impossible burger first came out. From this drop we can conclude that customers left because of it. However, later in the year and 2019, the sales came a little back up, suggesting that impossible burgers did not impact McDonalds as much.</p>

<p>Next, this is the break down of the chart above. It is the monthly sales over the 5 regions, North East, South West, North West, South East, and Center.</p>

<p>Although this chart might look too messy, it is still clear that there is a huge drop towards the late 2018 for all five regions, same as the first chart.

<p> Moving on to the overview of the 3 products: hamburger, chicken fillet, and fish fillet.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_UAPJrspqh3eICeKUF6qGoHGw6Zt55oJ/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>As we already know that there are drops towards the late 2018, from this chart, we can see that the drop for hamburger is significantly larger compared to the chicken and fish fillets. This suggested that the impact impossible burger made on hamburger is bigger than the other two products.</p>

<p>With these three charts, we can conclude that the release of the impossible burger from Burger King has a negative impact on McDonald's.</p>

<h2>Now, let's see some micro trends on the monthly sales dataset. Here I'm focusing on the sales for 2018-2019 only. </h2>

<p>This line chart is the total monthly sales for 2018-2019.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JXO-qnY9mSVfguazGzRv5YFEcUJ6FudU/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p> From the previous section, we can see the drop is around late 2018, but we did not know the exact month. With this chart shown above, it is clear that the drop is very notable. From September 13247269 dropped down to 11374035 in a month. But it did get better the following month.</p>

<p>This chart is a more detailed breakdown of the one above. We can see that all regions dropped significantly. But also went up the following month.</p>

<p>Next one is the products' monthly sales comparisons. Hamburger has the biggest drop compared to the other two fillets, and chicken fillet dropped a little more than fish fillet.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMmNiJPMuiso1M2FyuX65MmVtvarPoQ5/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

<p>These three line charts also suggested that impossible burger has impacted the sales of McDonald's.</p>

<h2>Moving on to the micro trends of each product by regions for 2018-2019</h2>

<p>The first one is the sales for hamburgers over all regions for 2018-2019.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yR_xZMz_BF2_hhKXq29UZuIsYOsh4oZK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>The drop of October 2018 is very large for all regions.</p>

<p>The second one is the monthly sales for chicken fillet over five regions for 2018-2019 too.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OJ89SsFHzmt4ECygieSPOhMftOqMpjUK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>As you can see from the chart, the drops are also super significant.</p>

<p>Last product, even though fish fillet's drop was not as significant as it was shown in the total comparisons, in this chart we can clearly see it dropped.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19d9rEV1XmF7xWcUs_WhML3ncjojRP9xn/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>These three charts are the individual product monthly sales over all five regions for 2018-2019. With the separations of each product, we get a better visualization of the dip in October 2018.</p>


<h2>Last but not least, let's take a look at the daily sales' analysis.</h2>

<p>In this section, I will be showing three different charts. The first one is the daily sales for January 2016.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VhNPNsryP4hhF8eeHF-R65IKST_PjBmg/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>This line chart tells the sales over the month of January. There are few drops but also some roses in the sales. But none of them are seasonal nor holiday related. Although the line chart seems like the drops/roses are huge, the numbers are not that significantly different.</p>

<p>This line chart looks messy, but it is the daily sales for January 2016 over all five regions.</p>
<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-agRDd0pxJApSF1MakToig504Y6igfZd/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
<p>As mentioned previously, the daily sales for January 2016 does not have any significant impact from anything, definitely not the impossible burger since it was not even out yet. We can also see that sometimes a drop in one region is a rose for another.</p>

<p>This last chart is a bar chart. It tells the percentage of each product sold each day. It is obvious that hamburgers took the biggest proportion out of all three products. And chicken fillets followed after hamburgers, then it is the fish fillets.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Overall, it is obvious that the impossible burger Burger King released has impacted McDonald's to a certain level. But the sales also came back up after a few months. But if McDonald's release special burgers or vegetarian burgers/products, it would have been a competition and perhaps even increase the sales a lot. However, with the lack of data from other companies/chains/products, it is hard to tell other trends such as the reasons why there are drops and roses at certain times of the year/months. But with the data we have, we can assume that the drop in sales in October 2018 was caused by the release of the Burger King impossible burger. Meanwhile, with the lack of information as mentioned, it is likely that it is caused by some other reasons.</p>
